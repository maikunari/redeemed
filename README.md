## Admin account setup

Registration is disabled by default in production. To create the first admin account:

1. Run migrations (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate --force
   ```
2. Register through the `/register` page **once**; the first user automatically gets `is_admin = true`.
   After the first user exists, you can disable the register routes or leave themâ€”subsequent sign-ups won't be admin.

OR create admins via artisan:

```bash
php artisan tinker

// inside tinker
App\Models\User::create([
    'name' => 'Admin',
    'email' => 'admin@example.com',
    'password' => Hash::make('secret'),
    'email_verified_at' => now(),
    'is_admin' => true,
]);
```

Use the admin account to log in and manage the site.
